a pedigreed cat is one whose ancestry is recorded by a cat fancier organization
a purebred cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed
the semiferal cat a mostly outdoor cat is not owned by any one individual
the domestic cat was first classified as felis catus
the domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are both diploid organisms that possess  chromosomes and roughly  genes
the cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful and specialized jaw
when it overpowers its prey a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth
another unusual feature is that the cat cannot produce taurine
this is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye
 although wildcats are solitary the social behavior of domestic cats is much more variable and ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that form around a food source based on groups of cooperating females
 within such groups one cat is usually dominant over the others
 each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory with sexually active males having the largest territories which are about  times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females territories
 these territories are marked by urine spraying by rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands and by defecation
 between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts
 outside these neutral areas territory holders usually chase away stranger cats at first by staring hissing and growling and if that does not work by short but noisy and violent attacks
 despite some cats cohabiting in colonies they do not have a social survival strategy or a pack mentality and always hunt alone
the domestic dog canis lupus familiaris or canis familiaris is a domesticated canid which has been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors sensory capabilities and physical attributes
although initially thought to have originated as a manmade variant of an extant canid species variously supposed as being the dhole golden jackal or gray wolf extensive genetic studies undertaken during the s indicate that dogs diverged from a now-extinct canid in eurasia  years ago being the oldest domesticated animals their long association with people has allowed dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior as well as thrive on a starch-rich diet which would be inadequate for other canid species
dogs perform many roles for people such as hunting herding pulling loads protection assisting police and military companionship and more recently aiding handicapped individuals in  carl linnaeus listed among the types of quadrupeds familiar to him the latin word for dog canis among the species within this genus linnaeus listed the red fox as canis vulpes wolves canis lupus and the domestic dog canis canis in later editions linnaeus dropped canis canis and greatly expanded his list of the canis genus of quadrupeds and by  included alongside the foxes wolves and jackals and many more terms that are now listed as synonyms for domestic dog including aegyptius hairless dog aquaticus water dog and mustelinus literally badger dog among these were two that later experts have been widely used for domestic dogs as a species: canis domesticus and most predominantly canis familiaris the common or familiar dog
